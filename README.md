## Project goals
> Keep it simple!

The website that I had planned out through wire frames and a low fidelity mockup changed during the development cycle. I did not end up using any frameworks, Javascript or jQuery in the creation of the website. Additionally, my main goal during this assignment was to understand more about **responsiveness**.

## Design & Planning

The design process included:

* Googling other people's portfolio websites
* Creating a mood board
* Brain storming what type of website I wanted
* Googling for minimalist websites
* Dissecting their HTML and CSS via browser's 'Inspect' tool to see how things work

When drawing the wireframe I used pen and paper which I personally found to be the easiest method.

<!-- Need to add photos of wireframe -->

After the completion of the wireframe I created a low fidelity mockup that differed from the final website.

<!-- Need to add an image here of lofi mockups -->

I wanted to keep my website simple, with only three pages; with one that contains all of my projects:

* Home / Landing Page
* Project
* About
* Medium
* Github
* Linkedin

The navigation is done through a navigation bar at the top of the page. This was done because I was thinking of future implementations to the website. They would be increased amount of projects as well as a complete redesign of the layout.

The choice of fonts was a result of popularity as well as the clean, simplistic looking style they both have. Moreover, the color was chosen due to the style of portfolio that I was aiming for (Professional).

## Encountered difficulties
### Landing Page

The header image as well as the two selector images towards the bottom of the page refused to cooperate with me. The would not scale when screen size was changed. I was able to fix this although, I am still not entirely satisfied with the way that I did it.  

### 'Project' section

I wanted for the images to be lined up how they are currently and change to a smaller scaled version when viewing on a smaller device. However, this was changed for the completion of the assignment; each project gets is own space when scaled on a mobile device.

### 'Landing & Project ' section

The hover over function for the images was creating problems for me. It would hover over not just the image, but everything. When this was fixed it would then only cover the image, padding, boarder and margin which is not what I wanted. I worked with Garret to go through the problem after I tried to solve it by myself first.

## Responsiveness

All the images and texts scale up and down with the browser's width. Much of the responsiveness is achieved automatically via **'viewport' meta tag**:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

In addition, **@media queries** were also used to account for specific elements.

## Intended audience

The intended audience for my portfolio would be that of programmers and employers.
