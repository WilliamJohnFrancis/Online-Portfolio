      <h2>CLI App Project</h2>
      <p>The CLI App (Millionaire Terminal Game) developed by myself and Allan Gao. The game was a learning process for us. Where over the course of the two days given for the assignment; I personally was able to learn more than the previous two weeks.</p>

      <h3>Ideas</h3>
      <p>The first step in developing the app was to brainstorm what type of app we wanted as a team. After brainstorming we transitioned into breaking down the pros and cons of our ideas. We eneded up settling with out first idea, that of the Billionare Game.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p> What had changed during the development process:
        <br />
        <br />
        During the development of the program it became evident that we were not going to be able to implement all the features that we set to be in the MVP.
        <br />
        <br />
        This was then dealt with by making the decision to forgo the feature in the MVP.
        <br />
        <br />
        Future developments were then included in the <a href="https://github.com/e3cd/Millionaire_Terminal"  target="_blank">Readme.md</a>
