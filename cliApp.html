      <h2>CLI App Project</h2>
      <p>This website was created for an assignment during the AIT (Australian Institute of Technology) course. The project allowed me to learn more about HTML and CSS as well as certain frame works (CSS grid, Flexbox and Bootstrap). Although, this website does not use any of those frame works.</p>

      <h3>Ideas</h3>
      <p>Before I began wire framing or creating the low fidelity mockup I was creating a trello board as well as a mood board. I looked at many different websites that would hopefully give me ideas as well as images that were similar to the 'look' I was going for.</p>
      <img src="./Planning/2 LoFi Desktop.jpg" alt="Image of the low fidelity mockup of the website"/>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>When beginning the process of designing and creating the wireframe and low fidelity mockups I did not realise the importance of understanding what the content would be before designing. I was headed on the right track just missing a few key components.
      <br />
      <br />
      Understanding what would be the contents of the page is extremely important in how the page is going to be laid out. Specifically this will be a portfolio site which will be viewed by employers. So I should be thinking about what employers would want to see and put that higher on the website.
      <br />
      <br />
      After thinking about what should be the contents of my website and how it should look I went back and sketched up a quite wire frame in a book then moved on to creating a new low-fidelity mockup (Which can be seen above).
